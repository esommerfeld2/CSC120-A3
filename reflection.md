Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?
I talked with Kylie during office hours. 
- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?
Friday 11-12 in Bass 105.
- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
I liked that you can call things from inside different functions but I keep forgetting that everything needs brackets or paranthesis around it. I am learning but it is slow and I spent a lot of time on this assignment. I'm not very clear on organization of things and where they should go espically since I'm no longer confinded by the linear thinking. But office hours helped with that and now I feel more confident. 
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages?
Programming in general has the same ideas: lists, loops, functions. How they are used and the nity gritty of it is different! 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I really struggled with creating a transcript mainly because my code was disorganized because I didn't know where to organize it. I did manage to get the outputs working but be aware of capitilization. I would say follow the instructions in the video and don't try to skip ahead.
